<p/>
<u>Further details:</u>

<p/>
- For each product, there are specific points in time where a reminder could be sent. For example: '<i>2 weeks remaining of our Green pricing</i>'.

<p/>
- Whenever you add a patent to your account, about half of the available reminders are set 'by default'. You can subsequently edit these.

<p/>
- Coming soon: The ability for you to set your preferences for reminders, thereby overriding the defaults.

<p/>
- Be aware that the scheduled date for some reminders may already be in the past for your selected patent, so such reminders will not be sent.

<p/>
- Colleagues: thePatent.place allows multiple users to each have their own login to your 'company' account.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>All users in your company see the same patent(s) and data</b>, but each can choose which reminders they want.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  When a user adds a patent, they are assigned the default reminders. Other users are assigned no reminders for that patent.

<p/>
-  If you purchase a product, you and your colleagues still all see the same data as the transaction progresses, but only you will receive emails about the transaction.
