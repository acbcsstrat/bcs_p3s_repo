/**
 * DummyDataEngine was created to TEMPORARILY provide data (maybehardcoded data) until proper data was available
 * 
 * Sometimes, it is approprioate for DummyDataEngine to return a class (a pjoo) - containing several values
 * as these classes are necessarily also temporary, this package is created to hold them
 * to ensure they are all removed in due course
