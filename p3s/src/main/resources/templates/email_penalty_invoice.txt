This was for patents:

Unfortunately, this payment was not successfully received.
As per our terms & conditions (hyperlink?), this transaction has failed and the attached penalty invoice falls due.
If funds were sent, you may want to contact us (email or? hyperlink?),  to arrange restoration of such funds, as appropriate.
We can still renew your patents for you. Just add them to the basket again.

Kind regards,
