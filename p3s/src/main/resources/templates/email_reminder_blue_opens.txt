Hereafter - <For BoxCleverDigital consideration>
<br/>
Suggest do NOT provide end date. (a) they know it (b) is longtime away - so encourages them NOT to renew
<p/>

Thereafter (which would be leaving it very late) we can still renew for a few limited days, at a higher cost, (reflecting the increased effort and risk to us).
