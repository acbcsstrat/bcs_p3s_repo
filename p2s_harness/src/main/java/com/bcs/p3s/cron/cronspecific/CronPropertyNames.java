/**
 * Convenience class of constants. Avoids typo errors.
 * 
 * Same logic as for P3SPropertyNames (which can still be used within Cron, 
 *  Indeed, SHOULD be used if a property is common to both).
 * This file is intended for Properties used in Cron, but not P3S 
 *  
 * Remember: 
 *   P3S has property file p3s.properties
 *   Cron has property file cron.properties
 * 
 * So if a PropertyName is shared across both, then that property should appear in BOTH files
 * 
 * Properties are in no particular order
