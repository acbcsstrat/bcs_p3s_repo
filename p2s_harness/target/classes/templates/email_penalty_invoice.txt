In creating thepatent.place transaction [TRANSACTION_REFERENCE] for renewing the below [NUMBER_OF_PATENTS] patent[PATENT_PLURALITY_S] you had agreed that the payment of $[PRICE] would reach our US bank account by:
<br/>
[TIMESTAMP_TARGET_FUNDS_ARRIVAL]
<p/>
This was for patent[PATENT_PLURALITY_S]:
<table class="tblpayment3colinvemail">
[THREECOL_TABLE_OF_PATENTS]<tr><td></td><td>[PATENT_APPLICATION_NUMBER]</td><td>[SHORT_TITLE]</td></tr>
</table>
<p/>

Unfortunately, this payment was not successfully received.
<br/>
As per our terms & conditions (hyperlink?), this transaction has failed and the attached penalty invoice falls due.
<br/>
If funds were sent, you may want to contact us (email or? hyperlink?),  to arrange restoration of such funds, as appropriate.
<br/>
We can still renew your patents for you. Just add them to the basket again.

<p/>
Kind regards,
<br>
